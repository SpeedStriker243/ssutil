SpeedStriker Utility

A front end for the Windows Command Processor (i.e. Command Prompt) as well as a few Pythonic features combined to create a command prompt style utility made for the less advanced users of Microsoft Windows, however that isn't saying power users can't also use this. 

As well as easily tying in with CMD features Python wouldn't usually support, a few Python modules like webbrowser, time and platform are implemented into this utility to help you do more things than CMD ever could. Don't try to use it on macOS or Linux, though, it's strictly for use on a Windows operating system.
